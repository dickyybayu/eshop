# Module 1: Coding Standard

## Reflection 1
Throughout this module, I have applied clean coding principles to ensure the code is readable, maintainable, and well-structured. I used meaningful names for classes and methods, making it clear what each part of the code does. Additionally, I ensured that different responsibilities were kept separate, which improves modularity and makes future updates easier. Functions were designed to perform a single task, following best practices to maintain simplicity and reusability.

Regarding security, I have implemented good practices but identified areas for improvement. Currently, there is no input validation, which could lead to potential issues with incorrect or missing data. Adding validation to ensure that product names are not empty and product quantities are always positive would enhance reliability. Additionally, error handling could be improved by using custom exceptions instead of returning null, making debugging easier and preventing unexpected behaviors.

Another improvement that can be made is data storage. Right now, the application stores product data in memory, meaning all information is lost when the application restarts. Integrating a proper database, such as PostgreSQL, would make the system more scalable and secure by providing persistent storage. 

Overall, I have gained valuable insights into writing clean and secure code. Moving forward, I plan to enhance the application by adding proper input validation, improving error handling, and integrating database storage. These improvements will ensure better security, performance, and maintainability for the application.
